## 🚀 About This Repository  
This is my **first GitHub repository** created as part of the **VSD SoC Tapeout Program (IIT Gandhinagar)**.  
Here, I will document my **week-by-week progress** — covering the journey from **RTL design to GDSII flow** in VLSI.  

The goal of this program (and this repo) is to:  
- Gain **hands-on experience** with RISC-V SoC design.  
- Learn the **end-to-end physical design flow** of an IC.  
- Contribute towards the vision of **Viksit Bharat** and the growth of the **Indian Semiconductor Industry**.

## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tool Installation  

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Task 0** | 🛠️ Installed essential tools: **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, **Yosys**, and **GTKWave** for simulation, synthesis, and waveform analysis. | ✅ Done |

---

## 📅 Week 1 — RTL Design & Synthesis Fundamentals  

| Day | Focus Area | Description | Status |
|-----|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Day 1** | Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis | Learnt the basics of **Verilog RTL design**, performed **simulation with iverilog**, analyzed outputs on **GTKWave**, and synthesized using **Yosys**. | ✅ Done |
| **Day 2** | Timing Libraries & Coding Styles | Understood **timing libraries**, explored **hierarchical vs flat synthesis**, and studied different **flop coding styles** for efficient design. Hands-on practice using Yosys and GTKWave. | ✅ Done |
| **Day 3** | Combinational & Sequential Logic Design | Designed and simulated logic circuits (MUX, D-Flip Flop, etc.), synthesized them, and verified timing reports. Strengthened understanding of RTL to netlist flow. | ✅ Done |

---

## 📅 Week 2 — (Upcoming)  
Will cover deeper insights into **timing analysis, constraints, and synthesis optimization**. 🚧

## ✨ Closing Note  
This repository will serve as a **living document** of my Tapeout journey. Each task completed will be updated here with proper documentation, code, and outputs.
